#### Employment
##### Target Corporation. Lead Threat Intel Detection Engineer. March 2017 - Present.
- Collaborates across cyber security organization (strategic intelligence, incident response, adversary simulation) to identify and mitigate emerging adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by leading intelligence collection and detection engineering projects
- Collaborates across IT services organization (endpoint security, proxy, cloud) to enable net-new data collection for the purposes of threat hunting and adversary detection
- Leads development of Strelka (enterprise-scale file analysis)
  - Parses full file content into events used in threat hunting and adversary detection
  - ~300 million files processed daily from widely distributed endpoints and networks
- Leads development of 1,800+ sensor network security monitoring (NSM) deployment
  - Develops metadata and analyzer extensions for Bro/Zeek that enable threat hunting
  - Developed rule delivery system that reduced deployment time from days to minutes
  - Developed framework for stable, high-volume file extraction (~400 files/seconds)
  - Developed secure, tool-agnostic packet capture retrieval system using gRPC that reduced PCAP retrieval time from minutes to seconds
- Contributed crucial discovery, design, and development work on a 9-month project to upgrade NSM platform to use Docker containers
  - Created data-driven testing procedures and led selection of system components
  - Developed methodology for balancing server resources via CPU pinning and process isolation
