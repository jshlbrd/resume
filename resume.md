  - Developed methodology for maximizing server resources through a combination of application CPU pinning and Docker CPU isolation
- Developed continuous delivery systems that reduced time-to-deploy from days to minutes
  - Docker containers, Suricata rules, and YARA rules
##### Security Technologist (Research and Development) <br/> Sqrrl (May 2016 - February 2017)
- Drove direction of Sqrrl platform by acting as a threat hunting, threat detection, and incident response subject matter expert for startup of ~50 people
- Researched established and emerging attacker TTPs
  - Performed research focused on DNS resolution activity that fully defined a major product release (Sqrrl v2.7.0)
      - DNS data record ingestion of Windows Server logs
      - Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) detection analytic
      - DNS tunneling detection analytic

##### Senior Consultant <br/> CrowdStrike Professional Services (June 2014 - April 2016)
- Primary researcher and developer for CrowdStrike Services' NSM platform
  - Expanded metadata collection by creating new protocol analyzers for Bro/Zeek, including the open-source RDP analyzer, and integrating Laika BOSS
  - Increased detection coverage by creating dozens of private and open-source Bro/Zeek scripts
  - Improved analyst workflow by unifying detection data (network alerts/metadata, file alerts/metadata, full packet capture) from four applications into a custom Splunk-based analysis platform
- Performed threat hunting, network monitoring, and incident response for Fortune 500 clients
  - Participated in 10+ engagements across unique industries, including aviation, entertainment, and manufacturing
- Created and taught two threat hunting training courses
  - One privately taught to a Fortune 100 client
  - One publicly taught at Black Hat
##### Analyst, Detection Operations (CIRT) <br/> General Electric (May 2013 â€“ June 2014)
- Threat detection subject matter expert for GE's 450+ Bro/Zeek sensor deployment
- Led research and development of advanced threat detection scenarios using Bro/Zeek
  - Led a 2-month project that determined precise, heuristic detection of attacker TTPs was feasible across GE's global network
- Developed methods of validating, enriching, and scaling tens of thousands of indicators of compromise (IOCs) across the enterprise
- Developed custom Bro/Zeek detection scripts, including heuristic detection for reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data exfiltration
